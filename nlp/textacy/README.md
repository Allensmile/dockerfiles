# Textacy

[Textacy](https://github.com/chartbeat-labs/textacy) is a Python library for performing higher-level natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the basics --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- offloaded to another library, textacy focuses on tasks facilitated by the ready availability of tokenized, POS-tagged, and parsed text.
